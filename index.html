    <h1>Hello Zayira </h1>
    <p>
        Im doing this at this way because its interesting. <br>
        I hope that you liked the yellow flowers, remember its never too late for flowers. <br>
        You must be thinking why Im writing in English, well im tryng something new. And improving my way of comunicate. <br><br>
        Look I wanted to write you something about a time ago, I just wanted to tell yout that I already was the man that you wanted, I change because I feel you wanted and someday I told you that when you change for good Its good no matter for who. <br><br> 
        In those months when I started to feel different that was the beginning of the change in my life at that moment you helped me a lot and I still need that help but you just decide that the better for me is to grown alone when I didnt have any else. <br> <strong>YOU</strong> were my motivativon you were all that I needed, but you just left me and I forgive you because I like to belive that you love me in a way that I cant understand<br>
        I never needed this what I really need is someneone who I can trust and cry in his shoulder when I need, someone who no matter what supports me and I was that person in your life. Why you cant be that to me<br> 
        Another thing that I want to say is that you remember that time when we were working together in the tank and I just wanted to go home because I was bored to be ther and you tell to me that you were surprised that I had not been bored with you, the truth is that I never wanted a work like that i always liked to be fancy, to take care of my nails, hair, etc. I never wanted that work I like to be in a computer doing great things. <br><br>
        I just did it because we needed the money. <br> 
        Because me as a man, I need to provide to my girl what she needs, Ive never stoped doing it. <br>
        Anyway, I see that you made Miguel's party I hope you are well speaking about feelings, I dont know if you already tell to all de family about us, if is that way well I hope you are well and strong about all this. <br>
        The reason of this is only beacause I already finisshed the book and I want to tell you, <strong>GRACIAS</strong>, I learn a lot of things if some day you want to talk about this just text me and we can go out somwhere you like. I invite.
    </p>
    <p>
        I always going to have something to say but I dont want to move you away more than we are.
    </p>
