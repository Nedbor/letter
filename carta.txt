Hello Zayira, 
I hope that you liked the flowers. You must be thinking why am i writing in English, well im tryng something new.
Look i was wanting to write you something about a time ago, i jsut wanted to tell yout that I already was the man that you wanted, in those months when I started to feel different that was the beginning of the change in my life at that momento youe helped me a lot and i still need that help but you just decide that the better for me is to grown alone when i didnt have any else. YOU were my motivativon you were all that I needed, but you just left me. Another thing that I want to say is that you remember that time when we were working together in the tank and I just wanted to go home because I was bored to be ther and you tell to me that you were surprised that I had not been bored with you, the truth is that I never wanted a work like that i always liked to be fancy, to take care of my nails, hair, etc. I never wanted that work I like to be in a computer doing great things.

Anyway, I see that you made Miguel's party I hope you are well speaking about feelings, I dont know if you already tell to all de family about us, if is that way well I hope you are well and strong about all this.

The reason of this is only beacause I already finisshed the book and I want to tell you, GRACIAS, I learn a lot of things if some day you want to talk about this just text me. 

Well i guess this is all  I add thi photo because I love it so much. Lv U. See you soon.
